# Bookhub

Bookhub is a library management system designed for user convenience, for both administrative and student user. It aims to decrease the time and effort needed for library operations, may be it a student borrowing a book or a librarian approving or declining a borrow request. It also has a feature that suggests books that a user might like.

# Future plans

**UPDATE:**

The Azure instance used to host Bookhub's frontend **__has been taken down__** due to lack of funds needed for proper hosting. It will be brought back up when the project has completed the backend development phase.

For the meantime, it will be hosted locally using a Raspberry Pi 1 B+. 


~~Bookhub's frontend is currently hosted on a B2ats Microsoft Azure virtual instance.  However, come the day that it has become a full-fledged system, comes also plans for fast operation.~~

The plans are:
+ ~~Use another B2ats instance solely for database operation~~
+ Upgrade to higher-spec instance, or local hosting
+ ~~Use React.js for code reusability~~
+ PHP for backend
+ WebAuthn & e-Mail OTP for admin auth
