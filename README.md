# Bookhub

Bookhub is a library management system designed for user convenience, for both administrative user and normal user. It aims to decrease the time and effort needed for library operations, may be it a student borrowing a book or a librarian approving or declining a borrow requests. It also has a feature that suggests books that a user might like. 

# Future plans

Bookhub's frontend is currently hosted on a B2ats Microsoft Azure virtual instance. However, come the day that it has become a full-fledged system, comes also plans for fast operation.

Our plans are:
+ Use another B2ats instance solely for database operation
+ Use React.js for code reusability
+ PHP for backend?
